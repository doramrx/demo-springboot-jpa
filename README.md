# Web Services Project with Spring Boot and JPA / Hibernate
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Spring Boot Project, a Java project for educational purposes. This is a sample project that demonstrates the creation of a Java application using Spring Boot, JPA (Java Persistence API), and Hibernate to handle web services. The primary objective of this project is to provide a reference model for creating a web service with CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations in a Spring Boot environment. The project also addresses exception handling.

## Objectives
The project has the following objectives:

* Create a Spring Boot Java project: Set up a Spring Boot project from scratch to create a web application.
* Implement domain model: Define domain classes that represent the objects to be manipulated by the web service.
* Structure logical layers: Organize the project into logical layers such as resource (controllers), service (services), and repository (repositories), following best development practices.
* Configure a test database (H2): Use the H2 database, an in-memory test database, to store application data.
* Populate the database: Insert sample data into the H2 database to test CRUD operations.
* CRUD - Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete: Implement basic operations to create, retrieve, update, and delete records in the database.
* Exception handling: Handle exceptions and provide appropriate responses in case of errors.


## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

* Spring Boot: A Java platform for creating web applications quickly and easily.
* JPA (Java Persistence API): A Java specification for object-relational mapping.
* Hibernate: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for handling JPA entities.
* H2 Database: An in-memory test database.
* Postman: A popular tool for testing and documenting APIs.
* Maven: Dependency management tool.
* Git: Version control system.
